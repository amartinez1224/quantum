GoodWood is an automated system designed for the control of the timber flow around Colombia, although it can be applied to another countries with similar transport and regulation conditions.

Goodwood is a solution based on the consumer, our philosophy is that the final consumer is able to cause impact in the decision of the big companies that sells wood. Our team have proposed a stamp that will be given only to the companies that are commited with the responsable exploitation of the raw material. But how can we assure that?

Goodwood is a Hardware and software solution, that checks the state of the timber carried by a transporter, our system measures the position and the weight of the truck that carries a certain type of wood. Every time that the systems detects an anomaly in the process of transportation it saves the position and the weight of the truck in that specific moment. This information will be sent to a server when it pass throught control panels stablished in strategic points around Colombia, and our system will compare the data to the permissions given by the authorities of the country. If the loaded place or the amount of wood does not coincide with the permission, then Goodwood will inform the authorities and the company about the irregularity.

This will help us to assume control and to be able to give the stamp only to the companies that are not irregular with the process of the wood transportation, given the opportunity to the consumer to choose products that are committed with the environment .

In order to run this project it's necessary to change the IP address of the components to match the server (Python Flask file) address for the localhost.
